# PhotoGalleries

A website to showcase the londonbikers.com photo galleries, both old and new. Currently in development.

Planned tech stack:

* ASP.NET Core MVC
* Azure Cosmos DB
* Azure Blob storage
* Azure CDN
* ImageFlow (dynamic image resizing - https://www.imageflow.io)
* Azure Web App hosting
* Knockout.js

Planned features:

Photos will need migrating from both our archive and the current LB photos website.
